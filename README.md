# 🏆 Tic-Tac-Toe in C

A simple yet interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in **C language**. This project is designed for **two players**, running on the console. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of **arrays, loops, functions, and conditional statements** in C.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Two-player mode (Player 1(X) vs. Player 2(O))
✅ User-friendly console-based interface
✅ Simple game logic with a **3x3 board**
✅ Input validation to prevent overwriting moves
✅ Displays the winner or declares a draw

## 📌 How to Play
1. Players take turns entering their move (row & column).
2. The game checks for a winner after every move.
3. If all squares are filled without a winner, it’s a draw.
